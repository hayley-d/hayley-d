<section>
  I am currently studying computer science and I have a passion for front-end development. I love designing UI's and see my designs come to life in my websites.
  I know most languages including:
  <ul>
    <li>Java</li>
    <li>C++</li>
    <li>C#</li>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>Node.js</li>
    <li>EJS</li>
    <li>React</li>
    <li>Bootstrap</li>
    <li>PHP</li>
  </ul>
  I also love gaming and would love to one day get into the gaming industry, I love to play games like Rainbow Six Siege, Assasins Creed, Pokemon, Sims, and much more. 
  I started out on my PS2 at the age of 3 playing games like Crash Bandicoot and Scoobydoo, my whole life I have loved gaming and when I was 15 I finally got to build my own gaming PC.
  These are just a few facts about me:
  <ul>
    <li>ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on RASA (Car website concept for my portfolio)</li>
    <li>ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python</li>
    <li>ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment</li>
    <li>âš¡ Fun fact: Blissey is my favorite pokemon</li>
  </ul>
